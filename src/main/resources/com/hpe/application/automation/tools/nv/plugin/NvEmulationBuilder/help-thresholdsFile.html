<div>Specify the path to a text file containing the tests' thresholds. Each line represents a threshold for a specific test.
    The structure of each line should be: &lt;fully qualified class name&gt;,&lt;test name&gt;,&lt;positive floating number threshold&gt;. A default value can also be provided for all the tests.
    The plugin will use the contents of this file to mark tests as failed. The plugin will fail a test if the duration of the test is greater than the specified threshold (or the default threshold, if none was provided).</div>
